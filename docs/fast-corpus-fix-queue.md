# fast-corpus pre-land fix queue

Working state for the Round 9 five-lens adversarial review (correctness, UX,
security, performance, robustness). **Items are DELETED from this file as they
are resolved**, each deletion committed with its fix. When this file is empty it
gets deleted, and the queue is done.

Dedup note: several findings were reported independently by 2-3 reviewers; those
are merged into a single item and marked with the lenses that found them.

## Verified on real DEV (2026-08-02)

- **Save round-trip re-verified after every Round 12 / F7 / F8 change**, 10
  consecutive saves with a byte-exact restore: editor release p50 44ms p95
  292ms; server-confirmed p50 530ms **p95 779ms** (was 1066ms, and 5070ms in
  Round 10). Criterion 4 ("Save <1s with durable intent") is now met at p95 as
  well as p50. P23 is closed.

- **F7 boot reorder**: boot-to-live 27,973ms -> 7,442ms, inside the 15s
  advisory budget. tombstone catch-up 16,052 -> 1,317ms, and the published
  plane 19,488 -> 5,559ms. `mismatchedPartitions=0` on both boots, which is the
  signal that the catch-up still completes before the trust gate — if the
  ordering had broken it would read 1 plus a partition repair.
  NOT yet run: the two-device delete-while-away and launder-vs-delta ghost
  tests. They need a second profile; worth doing in the acceptance test.

- **S4 purge**: cached Firestore documents went 1,625 -> 0 across a purge boot,
  measured with the network OFFLINE so nothing could re-cache and mask it; the
  request flag cleared, and the app recovered to the full 40,225 cards when
  back online. Only the HONOR half was exercised end to end (the flag was set
  directly); the sign-out trigger that sets it was not, because signing out of
  the debug browser cannot be undone without the owner's password. That one
  line is worth confirming during the acceptance test.

## Round 12 — four-lens adversarial review (robustness / perf / UX / data-loss audit)

Findings marked **[MINE]** are regressions introduced by this session's own work.

### P2 — UX consistency


---

## P0 — data integrity / release blockers

### Renderer crash seen ONCE, not reproduced
On 2026-08-01 the debug tab's renderer crashed immediately after unregistering
the service worker + deleting all caches and reloading (the heaviest
fetch-plus-prime path). It did not reproduce: the next boot completed in 11s
with 40,229 cards and a 550MB heap against a 4,192MB limit. One occurrence
under an artificial condition is not enough to attribute to the app, and not
little enough to ignore. Watch for it during the acceptance test.

## P1 — correctness

---

## P2 — UX polish

- **U14.** `card-editor.ts` switched from `?hidden` to conditional rendering for
  the Content/Configuration panes, so switching tabs destroys the Notes and
  Freeform TODO textareas — losing native undo history and scroll position. The
  text itself is safe in Redux. CONFIRMED by direct measurement (3 textareas on
  the content tab, 0 on config). ATTEMPTED TWICE and reverted both times: naively
  rendering both panes with `?hidden` did not change the measured behavior, and I
  could not explain why before running out of budget for a P2. Whoever picks this
  up: verify with a shadow-piercing probe that counts textareas inside
  card-editor's own shadow root across a tab switch, and note that rollup strips
  HTML comments from Lit templates, so a comment is NOT a usable staleness check.
- **U15.** `e` is a silent no-op (see U7/C3).
- **U25.** Reference blocks render as nothing (not "loading") until the worker
  can serve, and stale blocks survive navigation to a not-yet-loaded card.
- **U26.** Takeover shows a static disabled button for up to 12 s with no
  progress and no cancel.
- **U27.** `inert` is a no-op on Firefox <112 / Safari <15.5, which with U4 lets
  Tab reach live controls behind the overlay.
- **C14.** A single `card-web-edit-draft-v1` key holds one draft
  (`edit-draft.ts:17`), so two concurrently-dirty editors overwrite each other;
  `persistDraft` is also unguarded against `QuotaExceededError`.
- **R16.** Listener retry has no jitter and no `resource-exhausted` case; all 13
  listeners re-attach in lockstep after an outage. (The dead-handle accumulation
  half is fixed.)
- **R19 (won't fix as stated).** The 1 Hz synchronous localStorage heartbeat is
  real, but it is NOT safe to pause while hidden: `forceStaleTakeover` decides a
  tab is dead from `Date.now() - lease.heartbeatAt > OWNERSHIP_STALE_MS`, i.e.
  from that very write. Pausing it makes a healthy backgrounded tab look stale
  within seconds and lets another tab force ownership away from it, including
  one holding unsaved work. Attempted and reverted; the reasoning is now a
  comment at the call site. Making it cheaper requires changing what takeover
  keys on.
- **P11.** Boot round-trips the snapshot through wire format twice
  (`fromWire` then `toWire(stripForWire())`) — ~1-1.5 s of the 7.1 s
  `loadComplete`.
- **P12.** Cold sweep re-reads its own priority phase (5,000 wasted reads, 11%
  of a cold boot).
- **P18.** 4 synchronous `localStorage.getItem` + up to 2 `JSON.parse` per
  dispatch (`card-web-app.ts:437-453`, `card-view.ts:1040`); during a durable
  multi-edit the parsed record can include full card objects.
- **P21.** Impure `localStorage` reads inside `createSelector` result functions
  (`selectors.ts:1701, 2000, 2014, 2031`); `markCorpusWorkerUnavailable()` flips
  mode without touching Redux, so memoized worker-served collections go stale.
- **P22.** Measurement integrity: `test/perf-harness/gen-corpus.js` never sets
  `nlp_tokens`, so every harness card takes the slow full-NLP path — harness
  interaction numbers overstate per-card cost while memory numbers understate
  it. Also there is no heap measurement in the harness at all.
